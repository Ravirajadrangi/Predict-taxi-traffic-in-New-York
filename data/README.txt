Note: We downloaded the data in raw form. A sample of this raw-form
data is shown in raw_taxi_data_sample.csv. (The entirety of the raw
data consists of many GB, even when zipped, so we only include 50
rows of the data set here.) We then aggregated 4 months worth of the
raw data into the file pickups-aggregated_manhattan.csv.
