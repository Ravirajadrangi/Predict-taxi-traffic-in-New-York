[[File: Aioli-DelteEbre-01.jpg | thumb | The [[aioli]] is a sauce of garlic and olive oil that is produced by [[Mortar (tool) | mortar]]].] 
The first detailed evidence of the existence of dips back to the [[Roman Empire | Roman]], which used the [[garum]] (the salsa queen [[Cuisine of ancient Rome | Roman cuisine] ]), made with intestines [[fish]] (noting the [[mackerel]] from [[Cartagena (Spain) | Cartagena]]) [[marinated]] s in [[brine]] and fermented to sun and seasoned with spices. This salsa realizes the Roman gourmet [[Marcus Gavius ​​Apicius]] in the first century BC in his book [[De re coquinaria]], some of the names as 'liquanum' (used as a generic term to [[brine]] s, [[marinade]] s, [[lemon juice | juice]], etc). They have this same time that the emperor [[Titus Flavius ​​Domitian | Domitian]] repeatedly interrupted the political discussions of the [[Roman Senate]] to know what was best salsa with [[turbot]] he was going to prepare that night a [[wedding]] to your guests. 

It is possible that the [[Cuisine of the Middle Ages | culinary medieval]] in [[Europe]] had a poor existence of sauces and flavors were very spicy and bittersweet. One of the best known was the [[verjuice]] (a kind of [[must]] not [[alcoholic fermentation | fermented]]), the [[dodine]], the [[cameline]]. Distinguish between salsa and 'Grane' (beef broth awaited [[cereal | grain]]) is made. Gave rise to the English [[gravy]] <ref name = "McGee" /> The medieval food writer [[Taillevent]] mentions making some sauces in his book [[Viandier | Le Viandier]]. 

Since the [[XVIII century]] is already beginning to have a more refined and elaborate aromatic flavor. French cooking system begins to bear fruit in the field of making sauces, thus [[François Pierre de la Varenne]] (1618 - 1678) begins to write the first [[Cookbook | Cookbook] ] systematized. [[Marie-Antoine Carème | Marie-Antoine Carême]] (1784-1833) was one of the principal investigators and classifiers of different sauces into four families: [[Spanish salsa | espagnole]], [[velouté]], [[German salsa | allemande]] and [[béchamel sauce | bechamel]]. Carême showed as was possible from these four [[salsa mom | mother sauces]] construct a hierarchical system in the preparation of sauces known as the "French sauces system." [[Auguste Escoffier]] (1846-1935) promotes professional cooking range and reviews the classification previously made ​​sauces fellow Carême in [[Spanish salsa | espagnole]], [[velouté]], [[béchamel sauce | bechamel]], [[hollandaise sauce | hollandaise]] and [[ketchup | tomato]].

Hot sauces are subdivided into 'white sauce' (based béchamel and velouté) and 'dark sauces' (made ​​with the [[Spanish salsa]], [[glace sauce]] and [[ketchup]]).
